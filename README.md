# MITxPro-Real-Time-Bus-Tracker-Exercise
This is Real Time Bus Tracker Exercise Repo for MITxPro Bootcamp's Github Portfolio Project. In this exercise, an open-source platform called mapbox is being used for create and display maps on a web page. Bus stops between MIT and Hardvard will be determined through MBTA bus data. Animated marker on the map will highlight the bus routes.

# How to Run: 
When user click the button "Show stops between MIT and Harvard", bus stops with T icons will show on the map.

# Roadmap of Future Improvements 
I am planning to work on: 1. changing the style of animated marker. 2. changing the look of the map.
